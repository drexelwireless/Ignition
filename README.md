# ðŸš€ Ignition

Convenience routines for use with PyTorch.

**Beware of dragons!** This library is woefully incomplete and not ready for production use.

## Philosophy

Ignition aims to be a *minimal* framework on top of PyTorch. It's basically a general-purpose training loop and some handy helper functions. It does not try to abstract away everything into a "model" object the way Keras does.

Inspired by [Keras](https://keras.io) and [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), but different. ;-)
